# StudyBuddy

I was preparing for midterms and I had the idea to make a simple MCQ and Flashcards generator from PDF folders to help me studying without getting bored. It also previews PDF. 

### Technologies I used
- Client Side: Typescript, Axios, React, Tailwind, react-pdf
- Server Side: Google Gemini API, Express, Multer
